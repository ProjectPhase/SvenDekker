During a six-month minor at the RobotLab called 'Circular design with robotics', I dove deep into the worlds of Rhino and Grasshopper, exploring the innovative potential of parametric design and robotics. This journey challenged me to tackle complex projects, each pushing my creative and technical boundaries further. The portfolio I present here guides you through these projects, capturing the skills I developed and the learning curve I experienced along the way. From initial explorations to final project realizations, it reflects both the successes and growth moments that have shaped my understanding of Rhino, Grasshopper, and their applications in the robotic landscape.
