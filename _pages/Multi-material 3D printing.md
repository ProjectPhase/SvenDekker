3D printers are now highly accessible and have undergone significant development in recent decade. You can acquire a decent printer for less than 200 euros. This is fantastic for anyone who owns a printer because it encourages the sharing of more 3D files and the development of new printing techniques. One of the upcoming advancements in this field is multi-material printing. This offers benefits such as creating 3D prints that combine various materials, printing with different nozzle diameters (allowing, for example, faster infill printing), water-soluble support printing and multi-color prints.

For these reasons, there are already several solutions on the market. Each of these solutions has its pros and cons, but in many products, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. That's why the plan is to design a product in which the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
