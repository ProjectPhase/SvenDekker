Hello! I'm Sven Dekker, a third-year mechanical engineering student at HvA, with a passion for innovation in production techniques.

I'm currently immersed in a full-time internship at Fablab Waag, where I explore cutting-edge developments in manufacturing. On weekends, I switch gears to bartending, drafting craft beer and creating memorable experiences.

My goal is to stay at the forefront of innovation, whether it's 3D printing, automation, or sustainable manufacturing.

Let's connect and share ideasâ€”whether it's about exciting projects or the world of mechanical engineering.

Looking forward to connecting,
Sven Dekker
