Hello! I'm Sven Dekker, a third-year mechanical engineering student at HvA, with a passion for innovation in production techniques.

I’m currently immersed in a minor Robotic Production & Circular Materials. Where I explore 		cutting-edge developments with robotic arms using Rhino & Grasshoper. Weekdays after school I work at HB3D a company specialized in robotic printing. On weekends, I switch gears to bartending, drafting craft beer and creating memorable experiences.

My goal is to stay at the forefront of innovation, whether it's 3D printing, automation, or sustainable manufacturing.

Let's connect and share ideas—whether it's about exciting projects or the world of mechanical engineering.

Looking forward to connecting,
Sven Dekker
